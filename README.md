## Explanation

After PPRows opening source, it is unfortunately be copied by someone else, and charged to the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/lines-of-code/id1218789683?mt=12 ). Now, I need to explain it solemnly:

> The original intention Of PPRows open source is that I want to have the communication with the iOS / macOS developers. The code can be used free of charge, but It never be allowed to replace the UI and publish to the App Store having the charges. It is a low-quality behavior, üò°üò°üò°üëéüëéüëé.
